# Python-Dashboard-using-plotly
Here i have created a python dashboard with the help of plotly graphics package.
The data on which i did this work is India State wise Information from kaggle.
My dashboard presents the Indian state cities,suicide,crime and unemployment informations as visuals.
I have also applied a K-Means clustering algorithm inorder to find out the similar states in India based on crime,suicide and unemployment details.
